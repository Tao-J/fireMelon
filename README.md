fireMelon
=========

Someone had taken the watermelon up in the air, where it was dropped. Ohla, it's such a pleasure to hear the crispy sound it embracing the ground, enjoy the view the poor thing smashing into pieces with a plethora of juice bumping bouncing in all directions. Then it became the _fire_Melon, a pile of reddish limb.

	The place changes and goes, like a wind, like clouds
	Like the traces of the heart, no halt at the places.

> The place is so far away, be far apart
> People's hand does not reach, so merely has (the) worship.
> 
> The place is a lofty lord, can't meet nobody put on
> We will lose the place, so lofty which changes.
> 
> Not all were desired, however, we're never sad
> Still, there is still the place, far away, far away.
> 
> (The wind) blows through the place, an endless, with all
> Like the ripple float on the water, it blows as it goes.
> 
> The place is no make at all, nothing is shown
> Like the sand clasped by hand, it falls vainly.
> 
> The place is (a) profound lord, and wear the vain faint light

> 
> If not concerned with all, it will maintain that no dye

> Like the verdure (which) meets with sunrise, it grows up as reborn.
> 
> The hut has held new one that's different from all
> Like the sand castle of the children, but realized with the mind.
> 
> The person is a vain statue wear taciturnity calm
> Still, we will know a huge flow, it is stopped by nobody.
> 
> Soon, the wind wears the snow cloud, will be dyed to snow-white
> Summer grass will incline, no sunlight, feebly shade.

> The place buried in deep snow, like the collapsing castle
> Like the head of the shade, figure will be thrown away
> 
> The hut buried in deep snow, it sinks in to the flood
> and The "not dyeing" is dyed out, and waits for a oppose one.
> 
> Even if all are healed, be gonna no return
> There is still the place, far away, far away.

> Like the traces of the heart, no halt at the places.
> 
> The place is a lofty lord, can't meet nobody put on
> Still, there is still the place, far away, far away.
