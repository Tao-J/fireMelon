Here is the instructions and requirements for this "assignment":

NOTE: You can refer to the file "how2use_git" written by me, or just perform some search to get hang of this.

Check-points:

1.Create a repository (repo) on github.com

2.Put a Hello wolrd source file into that repo.


Advanced requirements(The order you performing these tasks doesn't matter, aka, they are independant, )

* Create a Makefile for that program and put it into that repo.

* Use ssh to manage that repo rather than https

* Change your avatar at github.com (fan qiang is required when accessing some web sites)

* Install MacVim and intstall a vim plugin named "Vundle" to it.

* Install git in Windows

#Something you can try for fun within win8
* Install Visio Studio 2012 Pro (Register an account at www.dreamspark.com using your @zju.edu.cn mail account, then you can download this version for free.)

Good luck, and best wishes.~
